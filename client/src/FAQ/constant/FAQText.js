            "We accomplish the second need - for individuals to find and access sharing and matching services, businesses, housing and organizations - by providing free and equal descriptive listings with website links to all Canadian sharing providers. This provides individuals immediate information and access to the services they are in search of, and in turn, provides the businesses and services maximum and immediate exposure to this large and diverse group."

        Q4:"Why it is important that you don't compete with other sharing services, businesses and matching sites?",

By serving all, we compete with none." +
            "Because the growth and popularity of shared living in Canada is in the early stages, many new sharing businesses, housing and matching services will be created. By freely and equally promoting them on this one non-competing site, they are immediately accessible to be found by that maximum number of individuals interested in the services they have created. This includes any new sharing service and housing opportunity. This provides immediate exposure to their target market, maximizing their chance of success."

        A7:"By providing a single central site for all individuals to register and search for others, the maximum number of individuals necessary to the success of all can be maintained. As has been shown in other Countries, if you are solely registered with one housing entity or matching service you will not have access to others registered with their competition. By registering with Hometogether.ca you are able to find others and continue to use the service provider you have chosen. The site also provides free links with full information and contacts to all sharing services and shared housing so that you can find and choose the service that fits your needs in your area.

        Q8:"Why do you need the information you ask for when I register?",

By asking for verifiable information, many individuals with unscrupulous intentions are deterred from the start, and we have the ability to check the info given if it appears problematic.
