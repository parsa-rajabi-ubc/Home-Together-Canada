  </h2>
  <p
    className="text"

    Home Together Canada is a volunteer-run non-profit Association with a mandate to facilitate the growth and success of shared living in Canada. We do this by freely providing the two fundamental needs necessary to the success of both the individuals, wishing to share homes, and the service providers and businesses wishing to serve this burgeoning and diverse group.We accomplish the first need - to maximize the number of individuals available to each other- by providing a single non-competitive, non-profit site with the basic preliminary tools individuals require to find others of similar mind.We accomplish the second need - for individuals to find and access sharing and matching services, businesses, housing and organizations - by providing free and equal descriptive listings with website links to all Canadian sharing providers. This provides individuals immediate information and access to the services they are in search of, and in turn, provides the businesses and services maximum and immediate exposure to this large and diverse group.

    Who is this site for?
  </h2>
  <p
    className="text"
  >
    This site is for individuals of all ages, all incomes, and all demographics that wish to pursue any type of shared living experience in Canada.This site is for all providers of sharing services and shared housing opportunities in Canada, whether they are for profit or not-for-profit. 
  </p>
  <br />
  <h2

    Why do you provide free listings and links to shared housing groups, businesses and service providers?
  </h2>
  <p
    className="text"
  >
    It is through our complete lack of competition and our free and equal promotion of all that we are able to help speed the growth and success of new sharing services and shared housing opportunities. These services and new housing opportunities are necessary to the success of the large and diverse population wanting and needing to pursue a shared living experience.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h2
    className="point-title"
  >
    Why it is important that you don't compete with other sharing services, businesses and matching sites?
  </h2>
  <p
    className="text"
  >
    By carefully providing only the two basic needs necessary to the growth and success of shared living, we are able to maximize and maintain the number of individuals available to each other and available to those wishing to provide them with services. By serving all, we compete with none.Because the growth and popularity of shared living in Canada is in the early stages, many new sharing businesses, housing and matching services will be created. By freely and equally promoting them on this one non-competing site, they are immediately accessible to be found by that maximum number of individuals interested in the services they have created. This includes any new sharing service and housing opportunity. This provides immediate exposure to their target market, maximizing their chance of success.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h2

    What kind of sharing services and businesses do you provide a free ad listing for?
  </h2>
  <p
    className="text"
  >
    If you provide a shared housing option or a sharing service that individuals want or need in their pursuit to succeed at shared living, you will be listed. Some examples would be:Businesses or groups that help match people, or help them write shared living agreements.Groups or businesses providing seminars or workshops on shared living.Cooperatives, co-housing and other shared living groups or opportunities. 
  </p>
  <br />
  <h2
    className="point-title"

    Why don't you match people?
  </h2>
  <p
    className="text"
  >
    The range of matching services needed to provide for such a large and diverse number are varied, and have only begun to be created. No single entity can provide for the needs of all.By remaining non-competitive, the maximum numbers needed to make it viable for others to create these varied services can be maintained. By maintaining these maximum numbers, we are able to aid in their success and ultimately in the success of those wishing to share living in whatever way they choose.

    What are the benefits of registering with hometogether.ca
  </h2>
  <p
    className="text"
  >
    By providing a single central site for all individuals to register and search for others, the maximum number of individuals necessary to the success of all can be maintained. As has been shown in other Countries, if you are solely registered with one housing entity or matching service you will not have access to others registered with their competition. By registering with Hometogether.ca you are able to find others and continue to use the service provider you have chosen. The site also provides free links with full information and contacts to all sharing services and shared housing so that you can find and choose the service that fits your needs in your area. PLEASE READ the first FAQ: What makes hometogether.ca different.

  <h2

    Why do you need the information you ask for when I register?
  </h2>
  <p
    className="text"
  >
    We endeavor to ask for enough information to allow us to verify a person is real and are who they say they are. By asking for verifiable information, many individuals with unscrupulous intentions are deterred from the start, and we have the ability to check the info given if it appears problematic. Other information like - gender, single, couple, age group, etc. - provides the basic search criteria for individuals searching for others to share a home with.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h2

    Will you share or sell any of my contact information?
  </h2>
  <p
    className="text"
  >
    No, we do not share or sell your contact information.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h2
    className="point-title"

    Why do I need a user ID and why do I use it instead of my own name on the site?
  </h2>
  <p
    className="text"
  >
    Creating a User ID that will identify you to others on the site, allows you to remain anonymous as you begin your search for others to share a home with.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h2
    className="point-title"
  >
    Why is it important to remain anonymous on the site?
  </h2>
  <p
    className="text"
  >
    Individuals have many different habits, likes, dislikes and personalities. Finding others to share a home with, is a process that takes time. No one wants to find themselves in a position of feeling pushed into making a decision prematurely. Anonymity allows you to proceed as and when you choose.
